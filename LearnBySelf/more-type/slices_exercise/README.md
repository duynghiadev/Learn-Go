# Exercise: Slices

Implement `Pic`. It should return a slice of length `dy`, each element of which is a slice of `dx` 8-bit unsigned integers. When you run the program, it will display your picture, interpreting the integers as grayscale (well, bluescale) values.

The choice of image is up to you. Interesting functions include `(x+y)/2`, `x*y`, and `x^y`.

(You need to use a loop to allocate each `[]uint8` inside the `[][]uint8`.)

(Use `uint8(intValue)` to convert between types.)

# Explanation

## Outer Slice (`[][]uint8`):

- A slice of length `dy` is created to hold `dy` rows.

## Inner Slice (`[]uint8`):

- For each row, a slice of length `dx` is created to hold the pixel values for that row.

## Mathematical Formula:

- The formula `(x + y) / 2` determines the pixel intensity based on the `x` and `y` coordinates.
- Replace `(x + y) / 2` with other formulas like `x * y` or `x ^ y` for different patterns.

## Conversion:

- The `uint8(intValue)` conversion ensures the values are within the 8-bit range required for the grayscale.

## `pic.Show`:

- This function from the Go tour library visualizes the generated `[][]uint8` as an image.

## Experimentation

Try changing the formula in the loop to create unique and interesting patterns. For example:

```go
row[x] = uint8(x * y)
row[x] = uint8(x ^ y)
row[x] = uint8((x * y) % 255)
```
